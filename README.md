## ESP32 S2 Libusb inspired library for USB Host

### WARNING: This library was developed to unblock me while I was waiting for official USB host support from Espressif, which has now landed with ESP-IDF v4.4. It is recommended that you use their USB host library code instead.

### Note: This library will not work or compile with any current ESP-IDF releases. This library works with ESP-IDF 'master' branch from ~May 2021 (pre-release v4.4). I used ESP-IDF commit 0x9d34a1cd.

See main.c for example usage. 

Supports Bulk and Control Endpoints.

Functional library, but not completely polished. Created while waiting for the official libraries from Espressif.
