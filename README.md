# WARNING: this library no longer works or compiles against any current ESP-IDF releases. This library only works with ESP-IDF 'master' branch from ~May 2021 (pre-release v4.4). ESP-IDF commit 0x9d34a1cd is tested and working.

# This library was developed while waiting for official USB host support from Espressif, which has now landed with ESP-IDF v4.4. It is recommended that you use their USB host library code instead.

## ESP32 S2 Libusb inspired library for USB Host

See main.c for example usage. 

Supports Bulk and Control Endpoints.

Functional library, but not completely polished. Created while waiting for the official libraries from Espressif.
